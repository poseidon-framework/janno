# janno

janno is an R package to simplify the interaction with .janno files in Poseidon packages. It provides a dedicated R S3 class `janno` that inherits from `tibble` and allows to tidily read and manipulate the context information stored in them.

Detailed documentation can be found on our [github-page](https://poseidon-framework.github.io/#/janno)
