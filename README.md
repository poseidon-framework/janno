# poseidonR

poseidonR is an R package to simplify the interaction with Poseidon packages. So far it mostly focusses on `.janno` files and provides a dedicated R S3 class `janno` that inherits from `tibble` and allows to tidily read and manipulate the context information stored in them.

Detailed documentation can be found on our [github-page](https://poseidon-framework.github.io/#/poseidonR)
