- V 0.10.0: Changed the representation of empty list column values. So far when all values in a string list column in a package were empty, then the resulting janno object (after reading) had only entries of type NULL. If some values were non-empty, though, then the empty values were vectors with one element of type NA. Now empty string list entries are always represented by NULL.
- V 0.9.1: Small adjustments in `upgrade_janno` and update of the source data for Poseidon v2.6.0
- V 0.9.0: Fixed (changed to a better algorithm) the HDR determination for the radiocarbon calibration, which effects the "Start" and "Stop" output of both `process_age` and `quickcalibrate`
- V 0.8.0: `process_age` now supports a simple start and stop date output, which can be useful for plotting
- V 0.7.2: Turned off double escaping of quotes in `write_janno`
- V 0.7.1: Removed post-R-4.1.0 syntax to make the package compatible again with older R versions
- V 0.7.0: Added a function `upgrade_janno` to update janno files from Poseidon v2.4.0 to v2.5.0
- V 0.6.0: Adjusted the package to Poseidon v2.5.0
- V 0.5.0: Added support for additional arguments to be passed to Bchron in `quickcalibrate`
- V 0.4.2: Fixed link in documentation
- V 0.4.1: Improved the message for additional columns in `validate_janno` with a suggestion mechanism
- V 0.4.0: Introduced a function to easily write janno objects back to .janno files: `write_janno`
